# F4LC025's First CS193 Homework

## Some of my favorite things about CS193 are:
- The class meets once a week
- The homework is enjoyable (so far)


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
